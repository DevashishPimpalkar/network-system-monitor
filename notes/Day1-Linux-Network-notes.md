# Network & System Monitor

This project is a step-by-step journey into building
automated system and network monitoring tools using Linux and Python.

## Vision
To build lightweight tools that help monitor system health,
network status, and infrastructure reliability.

## Phase 1 (Current)
- Linux system observation
- Network understanding
- Manual checks

## Future Plans
- Python automation
- Network health scripts
- Resource monitoring
- AI-based alerts (later)

## Why this project?
I am interested in systems engineering, DevOps, and
AI-driven infrastructure.
